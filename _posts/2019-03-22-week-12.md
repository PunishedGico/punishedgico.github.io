At Lorenz they use Google's [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) for their current machine learning needs.

It is an open source framework built using TensorFlow that enables you to easily train and use object detection models.

After installing it, which ended up being quite a challenge, I integrated it with my Framepicker class and tested it with an inference graph used for detecting trailers, supplied by Lorenz.
