subtitle: Experiments with ladders and ropes

Since detecting broken ladders and obstructions is the ultimate goal, I spent some time with several experiments.

Some more useful than others.

One of the more interesting experiments involved using the mask output from detection, so try to create a simple representation of a ladder. This would make it easy to detect crookedness and potentially obstructions as well. However to fully test the usefulness of this, a much better trained detector would be needed, since the mask generated by my current one barely resemble the ladders they are detecting.

I breifly flirted with the idea of using synthetic data as a basis for training. Specifically I wanted to procedurally generate ropes of various lengths, colours and configurations, since there aren't many ropes as part of any of the datasets I have access to. I didn't commit to this, even though I think it has potential. It is something I would like to work on in the future.
