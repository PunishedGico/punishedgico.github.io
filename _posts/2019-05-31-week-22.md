I thought of a way to streamline the labeling process for instance segmentation. Instead of having to add the bounding boxes to the masks manually, I could create a function that does it for you.

It searches through an image, until it finds a colour. Then we do flood fill on that colour to find its boundaries and we essentially end up with a bounding box. Repeat through entire image.

Using the Pascal VOC conversion code I wrote a few weeks ago, we can export this and thus eliminate a time consuming step in the labeling process.

And finally I wrote a script that takes source images, their masks and runs the bounding box function while creating a directory structure ready for training and copying the relevant files into it.
