In order to show images in Tkinter, we need to use Python Image Library (PIL). We can create a canvas in Tkinter and fill it with a PIL image. There's a slight issue, however. The image doesn't resize along with its parent canvas, so we have to do this manually.

Almost, but we obviously don't want the image to distort as we resize the window. We need to ensure that the image retains its original aspect ratio at all times.

~~~
def resize_image(self, event):
    w = self.image_w
    h = self.image_w
    aspect_ratio = w/h
    i_ratio = h/w

    if event.width/event.height < aspect_ratio:
        #Constrain height
        self.new_w = event.width
        self.new_h = int(event.width * i_ratio)
        self.y_off = int((event.height - self.new_h) / 2)
    else:
        #Constrain width
        self.new_w = int(event.height * aspect_ratio)
        self.new_h = event.height
        self.x_off = int((event.width - self.new_w) / 2)
