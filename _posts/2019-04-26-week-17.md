With a, somewhat, working detector the next step was to use that data to compile metrics from the videos it ran on. Including:

- Number of frames with detections
- Number of detections in each frame
- Total number of detections in the video

Using this it is possible to calculate the percentage of how many frames contain detections compared to the total number of frames examined. This "relevance" value can then be used to determine the likelyhood of a video being of a harbour, without having to actually look at it.

Adding a way to visualise this data was the next step. I figured displaying a timeline giving an overview of the detections would be both useful and cool.
