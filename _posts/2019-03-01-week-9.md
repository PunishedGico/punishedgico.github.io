After talking to Lorenz Technology about the project I began reading about Python. I decided to use Visual Studio Code as my development environment and later I would set up GitHub as my version control, with Lorenz' Azure server as an additional push target.

The tutorials at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ served as my introduction to the language. It ended up not being as alien as I had feared, coming from a C/C++ background, but a few concepts did take a while to properly click. Namely dictionaries.

At the end of the week, I challenged myself to write a simple program, using no external libraries, that could load a bitmap image and perform simple edge detection.

The inital attempt at loading had some padding issues.

After fixing that I was ready to attempt edge detection.

def edge(image, fuzzy):
    output = Bitmap(image.width, image.height)
    greyscale(image)

    for x in range(image.width):
        for y in range(image.height):
            p = image.pixels
            o = output.pixels
            c = 0
            for f in range(fuzzy):
                ff = x - (f + 1)
                if ff < 0:
                    ff = 0
                c += abs(p[ff][y].r - p[x][y].r)
                
            c /= fuzzy
            
            if c > 16:
                o[x][y].r = o[x][y].g = o[x][y].b = int(c)

    return output

KOALA IMAGE LOL

With a relatively high 'fuzzy' value. Isn't really useful for anything, but it looks neat.
