I found myself wanting to make my own labeling tool, mainly so that I could have it import the detection data and use that for adding a bit of automation to the labelin process. This however required a GUI. There are many options to choose from, but I settled on Tkinter, since it is considered "Python's de facto standard GUI."

I went through the tutorials at [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/python-3-tkinter-basics-tutorial/) and created a simple mockup UI for a labeling tool.
