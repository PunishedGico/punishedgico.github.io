The shortcomings of the SSD model became apparent pretty quick. Relying on just a bounding box is problematic especially if we're talking about object such as ropes. Any bounding box is likely to contain more non-rope than actual rope. This is where instance segmentation, or mask based object detection, comes in.

With this we can specify the exact pixels that make up an object, this should increase accuracy, particularly when it comes to ladders and ropes. The downside is that the labeling process is more involved, training times are increased, and inference is a fair bit slower ruling out the prospect of running it on a drone in real time.

Since Labelbox unfortunately doesn't provide the tools for labeling using masks unless you pay for it, I had to find an alternative.
[PixelAnnotationTool](https://github.com/abreheret/PixelAnnotationTool) fit the bill. It unfortunately only does masks and not bounding boxes, so it was still necessary to use a regular labeling tool as well, since instance segmentation requires both.

The resulting mask where each different colour represents a different class of object.

After a rather lengthy training session, using a dataset of only 7 images, we got'em.
