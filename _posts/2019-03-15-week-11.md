A simple image classifier in TensorFlow and Keras would serve as my first foray into the world of machine learning (ML).

Image classification is the process in which an ML model attempts to determine what the contents of an image is.

The tutorial at [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification) was used, since it goes through the entire ML process.

- Importing a dataset
- Building the model
- Training the model
- Running inference
