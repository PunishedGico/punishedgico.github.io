Feeling more confident about Python, it was time to start looking at OpenCV. Since I needed to extract still images from videos, in order to run object detection, it made sense to write a simple class to do this. It needed to be able to load a video and extract frames from it as individual images.

OpenCV makes this process very easy, so I could quickly start expanding the functionality of the class.

-Specify interval at which to extract frames
-Add "metadata" to include or exclude parts of the video
-Saving extracted images to disk

In addition I worked on making the class as robust as possible. In part this meant making sure every relevant property of the video was being used.

~~~
if self.vidcap.isOpened():
    self.vidinfo = {
        "width" : int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)),
        "height" : int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)),
        "fps" : int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)),
        "totalframes" : int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)),
        "length" : int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)) #Calculate length of the video in milliseconds
                   / int(self.vidcap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)) * 1000
    }
